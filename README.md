# Potato-disease-detection-using-CNN-and-LSTM
This project implements a deep learning-based solution to detect diseases in potato leaves. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers for sequential learning, providing accurate classification of potato leaf images.
